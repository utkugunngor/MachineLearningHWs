The code template is from the Jupyter Notebook used in recitation. 3 for loops added inside the ANN definition part which represents the hyperparameter configuration. 3 different number of layers, 3 different activation functions and 4 different learning rates are used for training. In addition to the test accuracy, a validation accuracy calculation part is added similar to the test accuracy calculation.

Run command is(for Windows):
	 "python the1.py"

This command gives training and validation losses at each epoch, and test and validation accuracies for each of the 36 configurations.
